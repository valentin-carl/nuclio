The job  of  the `functionres` component is to provide the mechanism to manage Kubernetes resources associated with a Nuclio function. This includes creating, updating, listing, and deleting resources such as deployments, services, and ingresses that are used to run and expose a Nuclio function within a Kubernetes cluster.

The `.go` files within this component are as follows:

1. `mock.go` - Provides a mock implementation of the `Client` interface defined in `types.go`. It is used for testing purposes to simulate interaction with Kubernetes resources without making actual changes to a Kubernetes cluster.

2. `types.go` - Defines various interfaces and types used throughout the `functionres` package, including the `Client` interface with methods for managing Nuclio function resources, and `Resources` interface representing the resources associated with a Nuclio function.

3. `lazy.go` - Implements the `Client` interface, providing mechanisms to interact with Kubernetes resources such as deployments, services, ingresses, etc., associated with a Nuclio function. The implementation is "lazy" in the sense that it delays certain operations until necessary, potentially optimizing interactions with the Kubernetes cluster.

4. `lazy_test.go` - Contains unit tests for verifying the behavior of the `lazyClient` implementation in `lazy.go`. These tests simulate various scenarios and validate that the client behaves as expected.

Each file generally maps to the description given above, focusing on either providing actual production implementations of managing Kubernetes resources (`lazy.go`) or defining the structural contracts (`types.go`) and testing those implementations (`mock.go` and `lazy_test.go`).
