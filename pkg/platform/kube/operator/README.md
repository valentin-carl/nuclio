This component's responsibility is to operate as a controller, handling Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). It manages the lifecycle of resources by reacting to create, update, and delete events in the cluster.

#### operator/operator.go
This file provides an interface for an Operator, which contains the methods `Start()` and `Stop()`. The `Start()` method is meant to initiate the listening to changes in Kubernetes objects, while `Stop()` is used to halt this listening process.

#### operator/types.go
The `types.go` file defines interfaces and constants used within the operator component. Specifically:

- `ctxKeyWorkerID` and `WorkerIDKey`: a custom type and constant used as a context key to uniquely identify an operator worker's ID within a context.
- `ChangeHandler`: an interface that describes functions handling the creation, update, or deletion of Kubernetes objects.

#### operator/multiworker.go
This file contains the implementation of `MultiWorker`, which is a struct that implements the `Operator` interface. The multiworker coordinates multiple workers to process changes to Kubernetes objects and maintain the desired state using the `ChangeHandler` interface. It uses a queue to rate-limit the processing and ensure retries of failed processing attempts.

- `NewMultiWorker`: a constructor function that initializes a new instance of `MultiWorker` with a particular number of workers, a list watcher, and a change handler.
- `Start`: initiates the informer, starts processing events from the queue, and waits for cache sync.
- `Stop`: provides clean-up logic and stops the workers gracefully.
- `processItems`: a method that each worker runs to read from the queue and process items.
- `processItem`: a method used to handle the actual processing of each item, including splitting item keys and calling the appropriate create/update or delete functions on the change handler based on whether the item exists.

These components, when combined, provide robust facilities for synchronously processing Kubernetes objects and ensuring the state of those objects is managed according to the specified business logic within a Nuclio function running on a Kubernetes cluster.
