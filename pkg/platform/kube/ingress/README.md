The Kubernetes component from nuclio/pkg/platform/kube is the `ingress` component. 

The `ingress` component's main job involves managing server authorization.
In the context of Kubernetes, an Ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster (typically HTTP). Ingress can provide load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting. This code component manages how these functions are created, updated and administered within a Kubernetes cluster.

This component comprises two .go files:

1. `ingress.go`: This file contains the definition and behaviour of the Manager struct, which is responsible for managing Ingress objects and their related resources within a Kubernetes cluster. Such management tasks include generating Ingress related resources, creating or updating these resources, deleting Ingress resources by name, etc. The manager is also responsible for generating htpasswd (HTTP Password file) contents, which is used for password protection in an HTTP Basic Authentication scenario, and managing any authentication related annotations on Ingress objects, such as enabling Basic Auth, OAuth2, or AccessKey authentication.
 
2. `types.go`: This file declares various types used within the ingress component. These types include structs for specifying the Ingress (Spec), authentication details (Authentication), Basic Auth details (BasicAuth), and Dex Auth (OAuth2 based) details (DexAuth). It also includes enumeration (const) for specifying the authentication mode (AuthenticationMode).
