The `Platform` struct represents the Nuclio platform on Kubernetes. It embeds the `abstract.Platform` which includes more generalized functions for managing serverless functions, and it extends this functionality with Kubernetes specific capabilities.

The `Platform` struct includes several clients (`deployer`, `getter`, `updater`, `deleter`, `consumer`) for managing Kubernetes resources such as functions (`NuclioFunction`), projects (`NuclioProject`), and API gateways.

Key responsibilities of the `Platform` component include:

- Creating new serverless function instances, building and deploying processor images (`CreateFunction` method).
- Fetching details about deployed functions (`GetFunctions` method).
- Updating existing functions (`UpdateFunction` method).
- Deleting functions (`DeleteFunction` method).
- Handling project lifecycle, i.e., creating, updating, and retrieving projects (`CreateProject`, `UpdateProject`, `GetProjects`, `DeleteProject` methods).
- Managing API gateways, including creation, update, and retrieval (`CreateAPIGateway`, `UpdateAPIGateway`, `GetAPIGateways`).

This component interacts with Kubernetes using the `nuclioio` clientset for Nuclio CRDs and standard Kubernetes clientsets for native resources. It uses these clients to perform CRUD operations on Nuclio's resources (functions, projects, and API gateways) represented as custom resources (CRs) in Kubernetes.

The key constants defined in this component are `Mib` which represents a mebibyte (1024^2 bytes), which is used for error message truncation when logging, and `Platform` specific clients for different operation types (`deployer`, `getter`, etc.).

The platform also provides methods for handling function events (such as `CreateFunctionEvent`), enriching and validating the configurations of functions and API gateways, and handling ingress for these resources. It performs authorization checks (OPA) and handles logs streams associated with function deployment or execution.
