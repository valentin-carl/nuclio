Component Path: nuclio/pkg/platform/kube/apis/nuclio.io

The `apis/nuclio.io` component is responsible for defining the APIs that the kube platform can interact with. It represents the various entities in the Nuclio platform like functions, projects, etc. in a way that Kubernetes can understand and operate on. 

Files in `apis/nuclio.io` component:

1. `register.go`: This file defines the group name for the Nuclio APIs. 

2. `v1beta1/doc.go`: This file provides package-level documentation. It also provides directives to generate deepcopy functions for the API types. 

3. `v1beta1/register.go`: This file is responsible for registering the Nuclio API types with the Kubernetes schema.

4. `v1beta1/types.go`: This file defines all the types used by the Nuclio API like NuclioFunction, NuclioProject, NuclioAPIGateway etc. 

5. `v1beta1/zz_generated.deepcopy.go`: This is an autogenerated file that provides deep copy functions for the Nuclio API types. These functions are used to ensure that when operations are performed on these API types, they do not unintentionally modify the original objects.
