The `client` component consists of Go packages auto-generated by client-gen, informer-gen, and lister-gen tools, which are based on the Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) for Nuclio. This client is used for creating, listing, updating, and deleting Kubernetes resources related to Nuclio functions, such as functions, projects, and API gateways.

The `.go` files of the `client` component are categorized into:

- `clientset`: Contains versioned client sets for the Nuclio API.
- `informers`: Contains informers for Nuclio resources, providing event handlers and listers.
- `listers`: Contains listers for querying and retrieving Nuclio resources from a local cache.

In each file, you'll find the implementation of the respective clients, informers, and listers, which contain code for the operations mentioned above. These operations are used by the Nuclio controller to manage Nuclio functions deployed on a Kubernetes cluster.
