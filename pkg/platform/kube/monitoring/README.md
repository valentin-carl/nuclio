FunctionMonitor is a go component that is present in Nuclio's Kubernetes platform package. It holds a logger instance, the namespace to monitor, the kubernetes client set needed for k8s operation, an interval for monitoring, and other necessary fields. The main function of the component is to monitor the health of a Nuclio function in a Kubernetes environment, identify when the functions are down and bring them up.

The File `monitoring/function.go` provides definitions for methods used by the FunctionMonitor:

- `NewFunctionMonitor`: Creates a new instance of a FunctionMonitor.
- `Start`: Starts monitoring of functions.
- `Stop`: Stops monitoring of functions.
- `checkFunctionStatuses`: Checks the statuses of all functions.
- `updateFunctionStatus` : Updates the status of function items.
- `isAvailable`: Checks whether a deployment is available or not.
- `shouldSkipFunctionMonitoring`: Determines if function monitoring should be skipped based on several conditions.
- `resolveFunctionProvisionedOrRecentlyDeployed`: Resolves if a function has been provisioned or recently deployed.

**FunctionMonitorTestSuite:**

File Path: `nuclio/pkg/platform/kube/monitoring/function_test.go`

The `function_test.go` file is part of the FunctionMonitorTestSuite, which tests the FunctionMonitor component. It includes various test cases that validate the behavior of the FunctionMonitor component such as `TestBulkCheckFunctionStatuses`.

**FunctionMonitoringTestSuite:**

File Path: `nuclio/pkg/platform/kube/monitoring/test/function_test.go`

The `test/function_test.go` file is part of the FunctionMonitoringTestSuite, and tests the function monitoring system of Nuclio. It includes various test cases that check the behavior and state management operations of the function monitoring, including tests like `TestNoRecoveryAfterBuildError`, `TestRecoveryAfterDeployError`, `TestNoRecoveryAfterDeployError`, `TestRecoverErrorStateFunctionWhenResourcesAvailable`, and `TestPausedFunctionShouldRemainInReadyState`
