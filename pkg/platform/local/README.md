 The `nuclio/pkg/platform/local` component from the Nuclio FaaS platform consists of the following files:

1. `platform_test.go` - This file contains a test suite for the local platform implementation. It defines a series of unit tests for various functionalities such as validating function containersâ€™ healthiness, testing deployment with volume mounts, and handling function import flows.

2. `types.go` - This file declares a Go struct `functionPlatformConfiguration` that includes configuration details for functions such as network settings and restart policies.

3. `platform.go` - This file contains the main implementation of the local platform. It defines the Platform struct with its associated methods such as `CreateFunction`, `GetFunctions`, `DeleteFunction`, etc. This struct is responsible for managing the lifecycle of functions including deploying, updating, and deleting them, as well as interacting with Docker to handle containers.

4. `function.go` - This file implements a function store, which serves as a representation of a function and is used for storing function configurations and statuses within the local platform.

5. `store.go` - This file manages a local store for saving project configurations, function event configurations, and function configurations with their statuses. It provides methods to create, update, retrieve, and delete these resources using the local filesystem.

6. `test/platform_test.go` - This file provides integration tests for the local platform functionality. These tests ensure that function container healthiness is validated, function deployment with volume mounts is handled correctly, and the function import flow works as expected.

The job of the `nuclio/pkg/platform/local` component is to implement the Nuclio platform interface for local development and deployment. It provides the ability to build, deploy, invoke, and manage serverless functions locally using Docker containers. By simulating a full Nuclio platform on a local machine, developers can write, test, and debug functions before deploying them to a remote Nuclio platform or other environments.
